              The skills we develop as technologists enable us to build <b>innovative</b>
              software, write ground-breaking research, and continue our life-long passions as learners
              in order to promote our movements in hacktivism and cybersecurity awareness.

              Intrusive is not filled with average high school students, but 
              <b>progressive</b> thinkers and leaders of the 21st century. With a diverse
              group of individuals, our unique skills enable us to come together as a group
              of visionaries and revolutionaries for the technological front.

              While the term "hacking" may have developed negative connotations in the past decade, 
              Intrusive is purely <b>ethical</b>, and our purposes aim from the protection of digital privacy to the security
              of systems and infrastructure.

        <h3>What exactly does Intrusive do?</h3>
        <p>
          As a nonprofit cybersecurity group targeting high school students,
          we aim to bring awareness to the information security and penetration testing
          fields through open-sourced software, conferences and meetups,
          CTF (Capture-the-Flag) competitions, writing and blogging, as well as recruiting 
          and meeting new AND experienced technologists!

          <h3>What if I'm not from the New York City area? Can I still be a part of Intrusive?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes! While Intrusive is NYC-based at the moment, we want to expand our organization so that it reaches
            all students around the world. While we currently host events within the Greater NYC area, we still hope to
            make them accessible to you through social media, livestreaming, and a TBA Intrusive meetup platform for
            hackers all around the world!

          <h3>What is the story behind Intrusive?</h3>
          <p>
            While there is a strong presence of opportunities for high school
            developers, there aren't many for those with interests in 
            information security. Our goal ever since the beginning of the group's conception was to 
            provide this opportunity to anybody wanting to learn more or dive into the field of cybersecurity,
            and pick up some new skills for their future. We don't care about race, ethnicity or religion - 
            cybersecurity is for everyone.
