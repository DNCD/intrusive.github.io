              The skills we develop as technologists enable us to build <b>innovative</b>
              software, write ground-breaking research, and continue our life-long passions as learners

              Intrusive is not filled with average high school students, but 
              <b>progressive</b> thinkers and leaders of the 21st century. With a diverse
              group of individuals, our unique skills enable us to come together as a group
              of visionaries and revolutionaries for the technological front.

              While the term "hacking" may have developed negative connotations in the past decade, 
              Intrusive is purely <b>ethical</b>, and our purposes aim from the protection of digital privacy to the security
              of systems and infrastructure.

        <h3>What does Intrusive exactly do?</h3>
        <p>
          As a nonprofit cybersecurity group targeting high school students,
          we aim to bring awareness to the information security and penetration testing
          fields within technology through open-sourced software, monthly conferences and meetups,
          starting CTF (Capture-the-Flag) competitions, writing and blogging, as well as recruiting 
          and meeting new AND experienced technologists!
        </p>

        <h3>What if I'm not from the New York City area? Can I still be a part of Intrusive?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes! While Intrusive is NYC-based at the moment, we want to expand our organization so that it reaches
          all students around the world. While we currently host events within the Greater NYC area, we still hope to
          make them accessible to you through social media, livestreaming, and a TBA Intrusive meetup platform for
          hackers all around the world!
        </p>
        
        <h3>What about sponsors? How can my company/non-profit help Intrusive?</h3>
        <p>
          We love sponsors and we willing to accept any that want to help our cause in any way possible.
          Please check the <a href="#sponsors">Sponsors</a> section of our website, or email sponsors@intrusive.tech.

        <h3>What is the story behind Intrusive?</h3>
        <p>
          While there is a strong presence of opportunities for high school
          developers, there aren't many for those with interests in 
          information security. Our goal ever since the beginning of the group's conception was to 
          provide this opportunity to anybody wanting to learn more or dive into the field of cybersecurity,
          and pick up some new skills for their future. We don't care about race, ethnicity or religion - 
          cybersecurity is for everyone.
