              Intrusive is not filled with average high school students, but 
              <b>progressive</b> thinkers and leaders of the 21st century. With a diverse
              group of individuals, our unique skills enable us to come together as a group
              of visionaries and revolutionaries for the technological front.

              While the term "hacking" may have developed negative connotations in the past decade, 
              Intrusive is purely <b>ethical</b>, and our purposes aim from the protection of digital privacy to the security
              of systems and infrastructure.

                    As a nonprofit cybersecurity group targeting high school students,
                    we aim to bring awareness to the information security and penetration testing
                    fields through open-sourced software, conferences and meetups,
                    CTF (Capture-the-Flag) competitions, writing and blogging, as well as recruiting 
                    and meeting new AND experienced technologists!

                   Yes! While Intrusive is NYC-based at the moment, we want to expand our organization so that it reaches
                   all students around the world. While we currently host events within the Greater NYC area, we still hope to
                   make them accessible to you through social media, livestreaming, and a TBA Intrusive meetup platform for
                   hackers all around the world!

                    While there is a strong presence of opportunities for high school
                    developers, there aren't many for those with interests in 
                    information security. Our goal ever since the beginning of the group's conception was to 
                    provide this opportunity to anybody wanting to learn more or dive into the field of cybersecurity,
                    and pick up some new skills for their future. We don't care about race, ethnicity or religion - 
                    cybersecurity is for everyone.
